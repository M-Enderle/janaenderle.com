            <p>Storage period</p>
            <p>Unless a more specific storage period is specified in this privacy policy, your personal data will remain with us until the purpose for data processing no longer applies. If you assert a legitimate request for deletion or revoke your consent to data processing, your data will be deleted unless we have other legally permissible reasons for storing your personal data (e.g., tax or commercial law retention periods); in the latter case, deletion will take place once these reasons no longer apply.</p>
            
            <p>General information on the legal basis for data processing on this website</p>
            <p>If you have consented to data processing, we process your personal data on the basis of Art. 6 (1) lit. a GDPR or Art. 9 (2) lit. a GDPR, provided that special categories of data are processed in accordance with Art. 9 (1) GDPR. In the event of express consent to the transfer of personal data to third countries, data processing is also carried out on the basis of Art. 49 (1) (a) GDPR. If you have consented to the storage of cookies or access to information on your device (e.g., via device fingerprinting), data processing is also carried out on the basis of Section 25(1) TDDDG. Consent can be revoked at any time. If your data is necessary for the performance of a contract or for the implementation of pre-contractual measures, we process your data on the basis of Art. 6 (1) lit. b GDPR. Furthermore, we process your data if it is necessary to fulfill a legal obligation on the basis of Art. 6 (1) lit. c GDPR. Data processing may also be carried out on the basis of our legitimate interest pursuant to Art. 6 (1) lit. f GDPR. The relevant legal basis in each individual case is explained in the following paragraphs of this privacy policy.</p>
            
            <p>Recipients of personal data</p>
            <p>As part of our business activities, we work with various external parties. This sometimes requires the transfer of personal data to these external parties. We only pass on personal data to external parties if this is necessary for the performance of a contract, if we are legally obliged to do so (e.g., passing on data to tax authorities), if we have a legitimate interest in passing on the data in accordance with Art. 6 (1) lit. f GDPR, or if another legal basis permits the transfer of data. When using processors, we only disclose our customers' personal data on the basis of a valid contract for data processing. In the case of joint processing, a contract for joint processing is concluded.</p>
            
            <p>Withdrawal of your consent to data processing</p>
            <p>Many data processing operations are only possible with your express consent. You can revoke any consent you have already given at any time. The legality of the data processing carried out until the revocation remains unaffected by the revocation.</p>
            
            <p>Right to object to data collection in specific cases and to direct marketing (Art. 21 GDPR)</p>
            <p>IF DATA PROCESSING IS BASED ON ART. 6(1)(a) OR (f) GDPR, YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO OBJECT TO SUCH PROCESSING AT ANY TIME FOR REASONS ARISING FROM YOUR PARTICULAR SITUATION. E OR F OF THE GDPR, YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO OBJECT TO THE PROCESSING OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA AT ANY TIME FOR REASONS ARISING FROM YOUR PARTICULAR SITUATION; THIS ALSO APPLIES TO PROFILING BASED ON THESE PROVISIONS. THE RESPECTIVE LEGAL BASIS ON WHICH PROCESSING IS BASED CAN BE FOUND IN THIS DATA PROTECTION DECLARATION. IF YOU OBJECT, WE WILL NO LONGER PROCESS YOUR PERSONAL DATA, UNLESS WE CAN PROVE COMPELLING LEGITIMATE GROUNDS FOR THE PROCESSING THAT OVERRIDE YOUR INTERESTS, RIGHTS, AND FREEDOMS, OR THE PROCESSING SERVES TO ASSERT, EXERCISE OR DEFEND LEGAL CLAIMS (OBJECTION PURSUANT TO ART. 21(1) GDPR). IF YOUR PERSONAL DATA IS PROCESSED FOR DIRECT MARKETING PURPOSES, YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO OBJECT AT ANY TIME TO THE PROCESSING OF PERSONAL DATA CONCERNING YOU FOR SUCH MARKETING PURPOSES; THIS ALSO APPLIES TO PROFILING, INSOFAR AS IT IS RELATED TO SUCH DIRECT MARKETING. IF YOU OBJECT, YOUR PERSONAL DATA WILL NO LONGER BE USED FOR DIRECT MARKETING PURPOSES (OBJECTION PURSUANT TO ART. 21(2) GDPR).</p>
            
            <p>Right to lodge a complaint with the competent supervisory authority</p>
            <p>In the event of violations of the GDPR, data subjects have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority, in particular in the Member State of their habitual residence, place of work, or place of the alleged violation. The right to lodge a complaint exists without prejudice to other administrative or judicial remedies.</p>
            
            <p>Right to data portability</p>
            <p>You have the right to have data that we process automatically on the basis of your consent or in fulfillment of a contract handed over to you or to a third party in a common, machine-readable format. If you request the direct transfer of the data to another controller, this will only be done if it is technically feasible.</p>
            
            <p>Information, correction, and deletion</p>
            <p>Within the framework of the applicable legal provisions, you have the right to receive information free of charge at any time about your stored personal data, its origin and recipients, and the purpose of data processing, and, if applicable, a right to correct or delete this data. You can contact us at any time with any questions you may have about this or other topics related to personal data.</p>
            
            <p>Right to restriction of processing</p>
            <p>You have the right to request the restriction of the processing of your personal data. You can contact us at any time to do so. The right to restriction of processing applies in the following cases:</p>
            <p>• If you dispute the accuracy of your personal data stored by us, we will generally need time to verify this. For the duration of the verification process, you have the right to request that the processing of your personal data be restricted.</p>
            <p>• If the processing of your personal data was/is unlawful, you can request the restriction of data processing instead of deletion.</p>
            <p>• If we no longer need your personal data, but you need it to exercise, defend, or assert legal claims, you have the right to request the restriction of the processing of your personal data instead of its erasure.</p>
            <p>• If you have lodged an objection pursuant to Art. 21 (1) GDPR, a balance must be struck between your interests and ours. As long as it is not yet clear whose interests prevail, you have the right to request the restriction of the processing of your personal data.</p>
            <p>If you have restricted the processing of your personal data, this data may—apart from its storage—only be processed with your consent or for the assertion, exercise, or defense of legal claims or for the protection of the rights of another natural or legal person or for reasons of important public interest of the European Union or a Member State.</p>
